# Explored designs

Every design idea that was measured, with the result, and why it was kept or dropped. The goal is
`PLAN.md` §1: `lz4`-class decompression latency at `zstd -1`-class memory, measured as Σ zsmalloc
cost (§3.1) and cold-cache p99 per page (§5.2). Add an entry for everything that gets measured, also
and especially for what did not work.

Short version so far: the gap between `lz4` and `zstd -1` is mostly how the sequences are coded, see
[Where the ratio of `zstd` comes from](#where-the-ratio-of-zstd-comes-from). Nothing built here beats
`lzo-rle` on memory yet. Two decoders beat `lz4` on cold p99, but only with formats that need 55.7%
and 70.5% of the uncompressed size, against 34.5% for `lz4`. The ratio has to come from repeats across
the whole page; local tricks on 8 or 64 bytes do not get there.

## How the numbers are measured

All numbers here are from the first zram dump of the development machine (`PLAN.md` Phase 1): 460 923
pages swapped out by a Fedora desktop, 5684 of them same-filled and skipped, 455 239 measured. Ryzen 9
7950X, one core pinned, `powersave` governor, so the frequency is not fixed. Every codec is built with
the kernel's compiler flags (`cmake/kernel_codecs.cmake`), the candidates with `lz4`'s `-O3`.

Two benchmarks, and a few rules that came from getting it wrong first:

* **Fast:** `tools/quick-bench.sh build <corpus> <out> lz4,<candidates>`, 26s for six codecs. The
  zsmalloc cost comes from the whole corpus without timing (`--no-timing`), so it is exact. Latency
  comes from a fixed random sample of 20 000 pages (`quetschn-sample-corpus`), interleaved.
* **Full:** `quetschn-bench-interleaved` on the whole corpus, 89s for six codecs. Only to confirm a
  result that goes into this file or `PLAN.md`. The fast one agreed with it within 2% to 4% for five
  of six codecs; for `spike-slots` the fast one said 1800 ns cold p99, the full one 2000 ns. So a
  difference below about 300 ns needs the full run.
* **Interleaved, always.** Separate runs drifted by 6%, as much as the effects measured.
  `run_interleaved` runs every codec once per repetition on the same page, in rotating order.
* **Reverse the codec order** when a difference is below about 200 ns. All codecs are in one binary
  and the code layout of one shifts the others: `shuffle-lz4` against `lz4` was +380 ns in one order
  and +210 ns in the other.
* **Buffers aligned like the kernel.** The output page is page aligned, allocations of a page or more
  too, and the compressed data starts at a different offset for every page, like zsmalloc objects.
  With 64-byte aligned buffers the difference of `shuffle-lz4` to `lz4` moved from +390 to -110 ns
  between two builds that only differed in how the corpus was allocated.
* **Nothing else runs on the machine while a benchmark times.** A build or a test run during a
  benchmark gave numbers that the next clean run did not reproduce.
* **Cold latency is not reproducible below a few hundred ns, warm latency is.** Adding `lz4hc` to a
  run moved `lzo-rle` against `lz4` at cold p99 from +40 to -390 ns, and `zstd -1` ranged from +1410
  to +2350 ns over five runs. The clock is not the reason: warm p99 was the same in all these runs
  within 1.5% (`lz4` 1990 to 2000 ns), and so was the cycle count (APERF via `rdpru`, `lz4` 10 595 to
  10 631 cycles), the core ran at about 5.3 GHz every time. In cycles the cold numbers scatter even
  more (`zstd -1` +7542 to +12 750 cycles against `lz4`), because the time spent waiting for DRAM
  grows with the clock. What changes between runs is how long the flushed lines take to come back
  from memory, which depends on the state of DRAM and the fabric, and neither timer controls that.
  So decoders are compared by warm cycles, and the cold penalty is mostly the number of bytes read:
  the output page is the same 4 KiB for every codec, the input is `comp_len`. Every benchmark prints
  the frequency range and boost state anyway.

## Baselines

Full run, all 455 239 pages. Cold p99 over all pages is what zram sees: for pages stored uncompressed
it is a `memcpy`. The last column is over the 290 693 pages that neither `lz4` nor any candidate
below stores uncompressed, which compares the decoders on the same work.

| codec | Σ zsmalloc cost | stored raw | per CPU | compress p99 | cold p99, all pages | cold p99, compressed pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lz4` | 34.5% | 10 523 | 16 440 B | 3500 ns | 2350 ns | 2450 ns |
| `lzo-rle` | 32.4% | 11 852 | 16 384 B | 3740 ns | 2330 ns | 2360 ns |
| `zstd -1` | 26.9% | 9638 | 169 728 B | 8650 ns | 3850 ns | 3880 ns |

The target is the gap between the first two rows and the third: `zstd -1` needs 17% less memory than
`lzo-rle`, and 60% more time at cold p99 than `lz4`.

## Where the ratio of `zstd` comes from

*The most useful result so far: the gap to `zstd -1` is how the sequences are coded, not the literals
and not better matching.* Code: `bench/lz_analysis_main.cpp`, `explore/zstd_nolit.c`,
`bench/kernel_codecs/zram_lz4hc.c`.

Σ zsmalloc cost on all 455 239 pages, without timing, so exact:

| codec | Σ zsmalloc cost | what changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lz4` | 34.5% | |
| `lz4hc` 1 / 3 / 9 / 16 | 32.4% / 31.3% / 30.7% / 30.6% | better matches, same `lz4` format and decoder |
| `lzo-rle` | 32.4% | |
| `zstd -5` | 37.1% | |
| `zstd -1` | 26.9% | |
| `zstd` 1 / 3 / 9 / 19 | 23.9% / 23.6% / 22.7% / 21.7% | |
| `zstd-nolit` 1 / 3 / 9 / 19 | 26.9% / 25.9% / 24.9% / 22.7% | the same without Huffman coded literals |

* **`zstd` never Huffman codes literals at negative levels.** `zstd-nolit 1` writes exactly the bytes
  of `zstd -1`, so the difference between `zstd -1` and `zstd 1`, 26.9% against 23.9%, is the
  Huffman coding of the literals and nothing else.
* **Better matching within the `lz4` format ends at about 30.7%**, reached at `lz4hc` level 9. That is
  11% less than `lz4` and 5% less than `lzo-rle`, with `lz4`'s decoder.
* So `zstd -1` gets from 30.7% to 26.9% without coding literals and with a fast matcher that is no
  better than `lz4hc`'s: through how it codes the sequences.

`quetschn-lz-analysis` puts a number on that. It takes the matches `lz4hc` level 9 finds, checks that
every page comes back from them, and costs the same matches with zstd-like symbols and a static
entropy model trained on the whole corpus (tables fixed in the decoder, because a 4 KiB page has no
room for its own):

| the same `lz4hc` level 9 matches, coded as | Σ zsmalloc cost |
| --- | --- |
| `lz4` format, what `lz4hc` writes | 30.7% |
| entropy coded literal lengths, match lengths and offsets, raw literals | 25.8% |
| ... with repeat offsets like `zstd`'s | 25.1% |
| ... and entropy coded literals | 23.6% |

This is an estimate: a real entropy coder needs a bit more than -log2 of the frequency, and the model
is trained on the pages it is measured on, so it is on the optimistic side. With `lz4hc` level 3 it
is 31.3%, 26.1%, 25.4% and 23.7%, the matching quality barely matters once the sequences are
entropy coded. A page has 636 literal bytes and 182 sequences on average: `lz4` spends a byte on
every token and two on every offset, where 4 KiB of page need 12 bits of offset at most, and
usually fewer.

Latency, preliminary: the cold numbers changed by up to about 900 ns between runs (see the rules
above). What held in all five runs, cold p99 against `lz4`:

* `zstd -1`: +1410 to +2350 ns.
* `zstd 1`, the same plus Huffman coded literals: another +1150 to +1860 ns on top of `zstd -1`, for
  3 points of Σ zsmalloc cost.
* `lz4hc` level 9 decodes with `lz4`'s decoder; against `lz4` it was +310 ns in one run and -490 ns
  in another, so no result yet.
* Compression, p50 and p99: `lz4` 1.9 and 3.6 µs, `lz4hc` level 3 8.2 and 11 µs, level 9 19 and
  81 µs. `PLAN.md` C3 allows 1.2 times `lz4`, `lz4hc` is far outside at any level.

For the design this means: an LZ whose sequences are entropy coded with static tables, and literals
raw, is worth about 25% Σ zsmalloc cost by this estimate, better than `zstd -1`, and the matcher can
be cheap. Whether its decoder is fast is the open question. `zstd -1` also decodes entropy coded
sequences and is slow; what in its decoder costs the time is not measured yet.

## Word model: WKdm-style 64-bit words

*Kept as a direction for the decoder, not as a format.* Code: `spike/`, `PLAN.md` Phase 2b.

Every 64-bit word gets a 2-bit tag: zero, exact match or high-32-bits match against a 16-entry table
of recent words, or literal. Four decoders of the same format:

| decoder | cold p99, compressed pages | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spike-switch` | about `lz4` (separate runs) | `switch` on the tag |
| `spike-branchless` | 3690 ns, `lz4` 2790 ns (separate runs) | masks instead of branches |
| `spike-zeroskip` | about `lz4` (separate runs) | `switch`, and 4 zero words at once |
| `spike-slots` | 1940 ns, `lz4` 2450 ns | table slot from the stream |

Σ zsmalloc cost 55.7%, 110 284 pages stored raw.

What was learned:

* Branchless is slower everywhere. Data-independent control flow is not the win `PLAN.md` §3.2
  hoped for.
* The win is a short dependency chain per word. The first decoders stored every word at
  `slot_of(w)`, a hash of the decoded word, so the store address waited for the table load.
  `spike-slots` takes the slot from the stream, and an exact match needs no store at all.
* `spike-slots` against `lz4` at cold p99: -480 and -820 ns in the two runs of PR #14, with 64-byte
  aligned buffers; -350 ns [-360, -330] in the full run with kernel-like alignment. The last one is
  the number to use.
* `lz4` stays faster on pages it compresses below 512 bytes, 73% zero words: it copies long matches,
  the word model visits every tag.

## Byte shuffle + `lz4`

*Dropped as a codec. The per-page result is a hint for later.* Code: `explore/shuffle.c`,
`explore/zram_explore.c`.

Byte `j` of every 8-byte word goes to plane `j` (the blosc trick for arrays), then the kernel's `lz4`
compresses the shuffled page. The idea: the high bytes of pointers into the same region turn into
long runs. Unshuffling works on 8x8-byte blocks with 64-bit shifts and masks, no SIMD.

| | Σ zsmalloc cost | stored raw | cold p99, all pages | cold p99, compressed pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shuffle-lz4` | 40.9% | 26 078 | 2770 ns | 2720 ns |

* Worse than `lz4` overall: 40.9% against 34.5%. Shuffling destroys byte-level repeats that are not
  word aligned, e.g. text: a text page needs 3543 bytes shuffled.
* But it is cheaper than `lz4` on 111 871 pages, a quarter of them. Taking the cheaper of `lz4` and
  `shuffle-lz4` per page gives 32.1%, as good as `lzo-rle`. Word structure matters for a quarter of
  the pages, and a per-page mode could pick it up.
* Decoding is 270 to 420 ns slower than `lz4` at cold p99: `lz4` decodes into a per-CPU buffer, and
  the unshuffle writes the page again.

## Base + delta per 64-byte block (BDI)

*Dropped.* Code: `explore/bdelta.c`. After Pekhimenko et al., "Base-Delta-Immediate Compression",
PACT 2012, a design for CPU cache lines.

Each block of 8 words gets a 4-bit mode: zero, one repeated word, or a base with 1, 2 or 4 byte
deltas (64-bit or 32-bit values), where each value is either base + delta or a small immediate, or
raw.

| | Σ zsmalloc cost | stored raw | cold p99, all pages | cold p99, compressed pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bdelta` | 70.5% | 162 920 | 1430 ns | 1490 ns |

* The fastest decoder measured so far, 960 ns faster than `lz4` at cold p99 on compressed pages. It
  decides once per 64 bytes, not once per word or per sequence.
* Hopeless on memory. A block only compresses when all 8 words are close to one base or small, and
  real pages mix. It is cheaper than `lz4` on only 9163 pages. Taking the cheaper of `lz4`,
  `shuffle-lz4` and `bdelta` per page gives 32.1%, the same as without `bdelta`.

## `lz4` with a dictionary

*A baseline, not a candidate. Kept in the comparison because zram supports it.* Details in
`PLAN.md` §9, next action 6.

* Trained on resident pages, measured on swapped pages: 2.4% less Σ zsmalloc cost than `lz4`, still
  worse than `lzo-rle`. For `zstd 3` the same dictionary costs 2.7% more.
* The dictionary gains 2.72% on the pages it helps and loses 0.35% on the others. In the extreme case
  an 8-byte dictionary makes a periodic page 1543 bytes instead of 49: the greedy parse gets stuck in
  a chain of short matches. Reported as [lz4/lz4#1805](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/issues/1805).
* Not measured yet: a dictionary trained on swapped pages, which needs a second zram dump
  (`tools/bench-dict.sh`).

## Not evaluated yet

* **Entropy coded sequences with static tables and a fast decoder.** The estimate above says about 25%
  Σ zsmalloc cost. The next thing to build and time.
* **Word model + a path for runs and long repeats.** Where the word model loses to `lz4` is exactly
  where `lz4` copies long matches. `PLAN.md` Phase 3, candidate 3.
* **`lz4` tuned for 4 KiB pages:** offsets limited to the page, word-aligned matches, a parser that
  does not get stuck. The `lzo-rle` route, the easiest merge.
* **Per-page mode selection**, e.g. between a byte-oriented and a word-oriented coder. The shuffle
  result says a quarter of the pages would pick the word side.
* **Entropy coded literals** on top, 1.5 points by the estimate, but `zstd 1` shows it costs a lot of
  decode time. Maybe only for pages just above a size class boundary (`PLAN.md` Phase 3, candidate 4).
* **arm64.** Every latency above is x86-64 only. The phone's little core may order these designs
  differently.
